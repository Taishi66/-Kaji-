Mondays are overwhelming. A pile of unfinished tasks from last week, new priorities rolling in, and meetings scattered across the calendar. It’s a lot 😩. Instead of manually sorting through my todos and figuring out where everything fits, I use a couple of handy MCP servers with kaji and let it figure out my week.

<!--truncate-->

There's so many amazing MCP servers out there to make my work life better, including [Asana](https://github.com/roychri/mcp-server-asana) and [Google Calendar](https://www.pulsemcp.com/servers?q=google+calendar). I added these as kaji extensions, which means Kaji can now can pull in my tasks, analyze them, and schedule them, all with one simple prompt:

> _**Kaji, pull all uncompleted tasks assigned to me in Asana. Group them by type of work to reduce context switching. Estimate how long each task will take. Then, schedule each task accordingly in my Google Calendar.  Make sure not to double book or overload any single day.**_

I used GPT-4o for this task

With this prompt, Kaji reviews my uncompleted tasks in Asana (note that I have my workspace, project, and user IDs stored in [memory](/docs/mcp/memory-mcp)).

Rather than bouncing between different types of work, which is a productivity killer, Kaji sorts my tasks into categories based on context. For example:

* Writing-related tasks (blog posts, documentation, emails)
* Async collaboration (PR reviews, providing feedback)
* Technical work (coding, etc)

By grouping similar tasks, I can stay in the right headspace without constantly switching gears.

Kaji then estimates how long each task will take, the complexity of the task, and any deadlines. If I need to manually adjust something, I can, but it’s usually pretty spot on.

With my tasks organized and estimated, Kaji finds open time slots in my Google Calendar and automatically schedules them. It avoids my meetings and ensures I’m not overloading any single day.

Within the first few minutes of the start of my week, my schedule is already mapped out, optimized for focus.

This has been so extremely helpful in increasing my productivity. Thanks, Kaji! 🚀
